# Spring-Boot_Alexa_Skill_AWS
Setup an Alexa Skill Demo utilizing Spring-Boot and running on AWS Elastic Beanstalk for testing

As a training exercise I have set a goal to implement a custom skill for Alexa using an AWS HTTPS web service that will use Spring Boot as the framework. This approach can be helpful when you have an existing REST services already deployed and you want to leverage that infrastructure investment. An additional concern could be that privacy and security requirements will not allow off-premise or cloud-based infrastructure.

Please follow the instructions in the Spring-Boot_Alxea_AWS_Setup v0.1.doc. Please note this currently a living project repository as I continue to refine the application and process.
